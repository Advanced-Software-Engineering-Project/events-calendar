# Columbia Events Calendar


## Introduction

There are many groups on Facebook that are associated with Columbia University, which makes it difficult for a user to search through all of the available events to find one that they might be interested in. Our hypothesis is that a unified event calendar of all Columbia events would make it easier for students, faculty and staff to find such events, based on key search terms, or a specific date and time. 
  
The Columbia Events Calendar will be focused around a visual calendar of events aggregated from the Facebook API along with facebook groups within the Columbia University community. This program will allow users to quickly view and obtain details about an event’s location, date, time, and hosts. Additionally, it will provide users with the ability to search and filter through events by date, location, and organization/host. A user will also be able to leave ratings on past events that are tied to their profile. These events’ ratings will be used to calculate an average rating for the group that they were posted by, which will give users a better suggestion of the groups and events which they might want to attend in the future.
