"---Update---
Conor Russomanno will demo one of OpenBCI's EEG headsets!

In collaboration with the Columbia Neuroscience Society, we are hosting a panel featuring researchers and industry leaders in the fields of neural computation and connectomics, as well as in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems development. Panelists include:

1. Conor Russomanno, MFA, SEAS '11 
Co-Founder & CEO | OpenBCI
Part-Time Faculty | NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program
Part-Time Faculty | Parsons MFA Design & Technology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe_cWeiY5G8
OpenBCI Mission: ""OpenBCI stands for open-source brain-computer interface (BCI). We provide anyone with a computer, the tools necessary to sample the electrical activity of their body. Our versatile and affordable bio-sensing systems can be used to sample electrical brain activity (EEG), muscle activity (EMG), heart rate (EKG), and much more. Our 3D-printable EEG headsets can be used to get research-grade EEG recordings."" http://openbci.com/

2. Dmitri Chklovskii, PhD, Research Associate Professor at the NYU Neuroscience Institute and the Simons Foundation
Research Summary: ""The human brain makes sense of the world and comes up with new ideas with an efficiency, speed and accuracy unattainable by modern computers. Our goal is to understand how the brain analyzes large and complex datasets streamed by sensory organs in order to aid efforts at treating mental illness and building artificial neural systems. We analyze experimental data, assembling connectomes from high-throughput electron microscopy and determining neuronal dynamics from calcium imaging and multi-electrode recordings. Empowered by experimental observations, we are developing a novel algorithmic theory of neural computation.""

3. Daniel Gardner, PhD, Professor of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College
Research Summary: ""The Lab's very newest project addresses a major barrier to progress in neuroscience. Contemporary neuroscientists record increasingly larger numbers of signals from nervous systems and correlate them with many behaviors and with disease states. However, this new capacity to acquire signals simultaneously from a hundred or more neurons or networks far outstrips our ability to analyze and to ask questions about these data, severely limiting progress. To address this imbalance, we have just begun to apply new massively-parallel computer technology to proven analytic methods. Such innovative enhanced analyses will enable neuroscience laboratories to derive greater insight from their data, and so advance our understanding of the relation of neural signals and brain function to sensation, perception, decision, and action. Our major impact, aim, and significance are encapsulated in the acronym NEAT: the Neurophysiology Extended Analysis Tool.""

"UCGT Talks with Professors Presents: 
Refugees: Space and Ideology, with Dr. Noah Chasin.

Dr. Chasin will be speaking about the role of spaces in the refugee crisis. Refugee camps are often deliberately created as the 'proper' spaces for refugees, thus segregating them from the rest of society and preventing their integration into communities. This containment raises questions about how the construction of space can be more or less inclusive and so affect refugees' experiences.

Dr. Noah Chasin is part of the Institute for the Study of Human Rights. His work focuses on the intersection of urban space and human rights, especially in zones of urban conflict. Dr Chasen is the recipient of multiple awards, including the John Rewald Memorial Dissertation Fellowship, the Mellon Seminar Fellowship, and the Getty Research Fellowship and has been published in Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, ArtForum, and Journal of Architectural Education, among many others.",2016-11-16T12:30:00-0500,Low Memorial Library,https://www.facebook.com/undergradcgt/events,429825127101923,196371364133087

*********************
(*Event Discussion Content Warning*: Islamophobia and related hate speech/violence) 

This panel discussion aims to address how Islamophobic political discourse maintains its social block of influence, and how as Americans, the Muslim, Arab, Sikh, and South Asian communities are able to act as agents of change in the upcoming 2016 election. 

The term ‘Islamophobia’ is directly defined as “the fear of Islam”, but is a broad phrase that includes the “prejudices, stereotypes, and discriminating actions resulting from unjustified perceptions” of Muslims and people mistaken for Muslims such as Sikhs, Arabs, and South Asians. 

Islamophobia has since heightened and spread intensely since the September 11, 2001 attacks and since the first hate crime murder post­-9/11 of Balbir Singh Sodi in Mesa, Arizona. Even so, such communities continue to be subjected to islamophobic microaggressions and violence in not only the United States, but also all over the world. In today’s political rhetoric, islamophobia has been exacerbated in attempts to combat international terrorism. 

We would like to thank the Office of the University Chaplain and the Kraft Fund for helping make this event possible!

"Formed at the disciplinary seams of the social sciences, the life history method is uniquely suited to observe and elucidate processes of becoming and being. The collection of life stories provides a tool to understand the ways that individuals come to see themselves at the intersection of multiple ways of being (LGBT, old, young, black, white)—articulating complex and dynamic selves.

Drawing from a multi-method longitudinal study of community-based organizers working across a range of movement communities in New York City, this talk asks: What are the processes that link a social movement actor’s identity or identities to issue orientations and action? Using the experiences of African-American LGBT and queer-identified community organizers, this talk will explore the use of both life history and network methods to identify and illuminate discursive articulations of identity that indicate more dynamic forms of protest and expansive claim-making beyond unidimensional issue framing.

"How do disciplinary politics promote the reproduction and valorization of particular voices while (implicitly) devaluing others? In the spirit of “listening for different stories” (Cruikshank 2005), I seek a conversation about whose stories come to matter within disciplines; about ways that scholars invested in projects perceived to be on the “right side of history” often unwittingly silence other narratives.

This talk follows from a collaborative project with members of a Kwakwaka’wakw ‘na’mi’ma (clan) who challenged dominant anthropological narratives reproduced through the Boasian canon and entrenched in “resistance scholarship.” Through intergenerational oral histories, archival research and engagement with scholarly literatures, members of the Kwaguł Gixsam sought a social language to portray a controversial ancestor who was critical of customary activities. Taking voice as a site of contemporary struggle within decolonizing research, this presentation explores questions about scholarly positioning alongside the projects of others and asks about consequences of disciplinary blindness. Whose publics really matter in the making of counter-narratives?

"The nature, form, scope and content of Indigenous oral histories make them seldom amenable to compartmentalization in academic knowledge categories. Likewise, many of the social science methods for evaluating Indigenous oral history sources are problematic. The transdisciplinary nature of Indigenous Studies (Native American Studies) creates a space in the academy for Indigenous research methodologies and Indigenous knowledge. 

This workshop by will examine the unique qualities of Indigenous oral histories and review some of the best practices on how to treat them with integrity within their own contexts.

Meet OHMA students and alums
Mini-interviewing workshop, taught by OHMA Co-Directors Mary Marshall Clark & Amy Starecheski 

OHMA is the first program of its kind: a one-year interdisciplinary Master of Arts degree training students in oral history method and theory. Our graduates work in museums, historical societies, advocacy organizations, media, the arts, education, human rights, and development. OHMA is also excellent preparation for doctoral work in fields like anthropology, history, journalism, and American studies or professional degrees in law, education, or social work. 

Jointly run by the Columbia Center for Oral History Research, one of the preeminent oral history centers in the world, and INCITE, a lively hub for interdisciplinary research in the humanities and social sciences, OHMA connects students with the intellectual resources of a major research university, and with the intimate society of a small cohort of talented students.

During a year at OHMA, students learn the skills of digital audio and video production and editing, digital archiving, oral history project design and interviewing, and both historical and social science analysis. Working with an OHMA faculty member, each student is guided through the process of creating a thesis or capstone project. Past projects have taken the form of academic and creative essays, film and audio documentaries, performances, exhibits, and multimedia websites. OHMA students also have access to elective courses taught anywhere within the University and exclusive oral history internship opportunities.

Please review our admissions page for further information and RSVP to our Eventbrite page in the ticket section above. We looking forward to meeting you in person on January 26!

"Using the experiences of Lower East Side squatters navigating the legalization of their buildings as a case study, OHMA Co-Director Amy Starecheski asks: What can anthropologists learn by studying oral history as a social practice?

By both using oral history as a research method and taking historical production as an object of analysis, Starecheski’s research illuminates the key roles that history-making and public storytelling play in making and legitimating collective claims to the city. Shared history is one key way that a group of individuals becomes a community. But how is shared experience transformed into history? And how do people deal with the inevitable conflicts that arise when complicated intersecting lives become public narratives about the past?

"Below the Grid is the public practice defining John Kuo Wei Tchen's current curatorial, research, and teaching work. In part it references the foundational Anglo-Dutch Protestant political culture below the 1811 city grid starting at Houston Street but it also references the compounded subaltern and subalternative intermingled lives and improvised experiences which give character to downtown's port culture, a culture far beyond simply the wealthy and the powerful.

The dialogic, shared meaning-making potential of oral historical engagement can open to a non-didactic, reflective practice of embodied historical knowing. BTG has three facets--its is an approach towards decolonizing intersected experiences, it is a reframing of what is of value, and it is a re-enlivening of everyday meanings and stakes of being here now.

"Twenty-five years after the 1991 Crown Heights riot, Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) has launched Voices of Crown Heights, in an effort to listen beyond the din of riot-based histories for the unheard voices and overlooked narratives in BHS’s existing oral history collections, and through new oral histories of previously overlooked people and communities in Crown Heights. 

Using BHS’s Voices of Crown Heights as an example, this presentation will explore what it means to be a listening institution that collects, preserves, curates, and presents oral histories; and how programming that cultivates public listening to diverse histories and experiences can create opportunities for civic listening.

"“In A Different Key: The Story of Autism” is a book that was more than seven years in the making, and since its publication this year, it has advanced the discussion about autism in the public and medical worlds.

IN OUR NOVEMBER NARRATIVE MEDICINE ROUNDS, Emmy Award–winning correspondent John Donvan and Peabody Award–winning television news producer Caren Zucker will talk about the book, a narrative that offers new insight into the seminal moments of the past near-century: the rise of the disability rights movement, deinstitutionalization, the effort to mainstream those on the spectrum, breakthroughs in neuroscience and our understanding of the mind, and the birth of the neurodiversity movement.

Donvan and Zucker, whose own families have been affected by autism, have been on the front lines of reporting on the social, medical, and legal aspects of autism since 1999, even before it became a national topic of conversation. Their groundbreaking ABC News series, Echoes of Autism, launched in the early 2000s as network television’s first regular autism beat.


John Donvan is a multiple Emmy Award-winning Nightline correspondent with a long career in journalism. Prior to serving as a regular correspondent to Nightline, he was the Chief White House Correspondent for ABC News. He is the moderator for Intelligence Squared US debates, heard on NPR stations, and has also performed on stage, starring in his truth-based One Man Show, Lose the Kid.

Caren Zucker is an award-winning veteran television news producer who has worked most extensively with ABC News. In addition to her experience in breaking news and live broadcast, she produced and co-wrote a six-part series on autism for PBS in 2011. In 2010, John and Caren co-wrote a piece for Atlantic magazine, ""Autism's First Child"", which was a finalist for the National Magazine Award.",2016-11-02T17:00:00-0400,630 West 168th St 4th floor Faculty Club,https://www.facebook.com/ColumbiaNarrativeMedicine/events,125575980857114,577009232506324
"Oct 28-30, 2016
http://narrativemedicine.org/workshop-oct2016.html

NEW: Early bird registration until September 9! 

Come work and study with us for a weekend. Gather with colleagues from the world over to learn the narrative skills of close reading, attentive listening, and creative writing. Find out how your own imagination can reveal things you know unawares. Experience the deep bonds that can form among clinicians and those who care about health care in short periods of small group intensive narrative work. Recognize and be recognized as ones who have care within them. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many persons engaged in health care, either as patients or providers, are hungry to give and receive care. Attentive listening, creative contact, singular accuracy, and personal fidelity have gone missing from the routines of our practices. Among the many responses to the failures of our current health care system is Narrative Medicine. Developed at Columbia University in 2000, Narrative Medicine fortifies clinical practice with the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by stories of illness. We realize that the care of the sick unfolds in stories, and we recognize that the central event of health care is for a patient to give an account of self and a clinician to skillfully receive it. 

The clinical routines and the teaching methods of Narrative Medicine, our experience and research show, can transform practice and training. Time-tested teaching approaches can help participants who seek to convey to their learners the skills of empathic interviewing, reflective practice, narrative ethics, self-awareness, and creating and sustaining healing intersubjective contact with patients and colleagues.

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:
From Friday at 2 pm to Sunday at 5 pm, participants gather for plenary presentations by the founders of the Program in Narrative Medicine alternating with small-group seminars. You and seven other participants will form a small group that stays together for the entire weekend, while faculty facilitators rotate through the groups. The large presentations by faculty open up themes of how stories work, creativity, ethics, bearing witness, and empathy, while the small groups practice rigorous skills in close reading, creative writing, and responding to the writings of others. Participants will receive a packet of readings prior to the conference that will include seminar articles in the field of narrative medicine by leading educators.

PARTICIPANTS WILL:
* Develop the narrative competence to nourish empathic doctor-patient relationships
* Learn narrative communication strategies for patient-centered and life-framed practice
* Build habits of reflective practice that enhance professionalism and nurture clinical communities
* Acquire pedagogic skills to teach methods of narrative medicine
* Replace isolation with affiliation, cultivate enduring collegial alliances, and reveal meaning in clinical practice
* Held at the Columbia University Medical Center campus, these weekends will provide opportunities for individual consultations with faculty, shared meals, informal social gatherings, and access to the cultural offerings of New York City.

DISCOUNT FOR COHORTS:
Based on our experience that cohorts of participants from an institution are better able to continue their narrative learning and to ignite narrative projects at their home institution, we now offer a discount of $100 on the tuition of each individual who attends within a cohort of two or more.

Continuing Education credits are offered for physicians, dentists, and social workers.

Our plan is to meet up at the Bronx County Courthouse steps, mass up at the rest stops, complete the 40 mile route, then decide as a group at the end of the ride where to get celebratory food and drink. 

Look for a FB post on the event page the morning of to find out where exactly in the park we'll be getting together. I'll be there at 7:30 to claim a spot where it'll be easy to find each other. 

We will do our best to stick together but please be sure to exchange phone numbers as we are likely to get separated between mass up spots since there will be so many cyclists sharing the road with us!

Come meet the artist and hear his take on Judaism, Creativity and the arts.  Wine & Cheese. 

Featured Artist: Yitzchok Moully

As a child Rabbi Yitzchok Moully’s upbringing was off the beaten path. Raised by former hippies, Moully was exposed to far more color than one would expect in the rigorously orthodox Chassidic community. Moully’s formal education in day schools in Australia and later at the Rabbinical College of America did not include formal art classes but his inner passion yearned for expression. After dabbling in various forms of art Moully found an expression for his creativity in the silkscreen process.
Moully’s art contrasts strong Judaic and Chassidic images with vibrant bold colors to create a startling combination which he describes as “Chassidic Pop Art”.
Moully’s art reveals that the essence of Chassidic thought is far from black and white.
Under the black hat there is a wealth of vibrant colorful energy waiting to be released.
Yitzchok Moully is the founder of The Creative Soul and lives in Hillside NJ, together with his wife Batsheva and six children.

"A Special Book Talk with Anaheed Al-Hardan, Assistant professor of sociology at the American University of Beirut.

One hundred thousand Palestinians fled to Syria after being expelled from Palestine upon the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Integrating into Syrian society over time, their experience stands in stark contrast to the plight of Palestinian refugees in other Arab countries, leading to different ways through which to understand the 1948 Nakba, or catastrophe, in their popular memory.

Conducting interviews with first-, second-, and third-generation members of Syria's Palestinian community, Anaheed Al-Hardan follows the evolution of the Nakba—the central signifier of the Palestinian refugee past and present—in Arab intellectual discourses, Syria's Palestinian politics, and the community's memorialization. Al-Hardan's sophisticated research sheds light on the enduring relevance of the Nakba among the communities it helped create, while challenging the nationalist and patriotic idea that memories of the Nakba are static and universally shared among Palestinians. Her study also critically tracks the Nakba's changing meaning in light of Syria's twenty-first-century civil war.",2016-11-14T12:30:00-0500,Center for Palestine Studies at Columbia University,https://www.facebook.com/CUPalestine/events,199655780070317,1843396019229919

"Brought to you by Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine for Queer Awareness Month at Columbia University 

From Palestine to Canada to the Philippines, indigenous communities with rich legacies of queer and trans life find themselves targeted by imperialist projects. Using the language of gay rights, colonial forces—among them the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel— justify ongoing occupation, racism, and xenophobia against marginalized societies. By promoting stereotypes that paint such societies as “backwards,” imperial Western powers seek to mask the oppressive forces underlying seemingly-accepting, pro-LGBT governments.

Who’s the good gay and the bad gay in the eyes of an empire? What are the boundaries of an imperialist LGBT agenda— does it cross walls? Under what conditions are identities protected or erased? Who is seen? Who is silenced? Join Columbia SJP for Queer Awareness Month 2016 in a discussion about queer rights, indigeneity and occupation from an anti-imperialist perspective.

"Ricarrdo Valentine and Orlando Zane Hunter, Jr. of Brother(hood) Dance! will delight us with a dance performance called Black Jones. Through a ritualistic process, they intend to create and dream of a safe space for black men to activate their emotional and spiritual selves that are denied in contemporary religious dogma. 

Black Jones is an exploration of manhood through the naked lens of two same-gender-loving men. Inspired by ShiKeith’s #Blackmendream project, this new work will investigate the humanistic and emotional connection that is viciously suffocated by the lack of societal images of black male intimacy. They question the notion of vulnerability when connecting with one's self and others. How does one detach from their fears and insecurities to live authentically under heteronormative standards? What does black male intimacy look like in different spaces globally and how are those bodies navigating, connecting, and resisting in a society with harshly strict perceptions?",2016-10-27T19:00:00-0400,Columbia University Office of the University Chaplain,https://www.facebook.com/columbiaouc/events,1699189460312034,1236988563018242

"Queer Awarness Month at Columbia University, The Helix Queer Performance Network, Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, and Columbia Queer Alliance Present: 

BOOM CLAP SHHH: Queer Anti-Zionist Performance From the Arab & Jewish Diasporas

Featuring: Mette LouLou von Kohl, Una Aya Osato, and m.b. with a moderated discussion after the performances.

Friday, October 28th at 8:00 PM
Lerner Hall, 2920 Broadway, 5th Floor Blackbox Theatre

Ticket information TBA.

ABOUT THE EVENT AND PERFORMERS:

In a landscape where queer identity is so often used as a smokescreen to distract from Israeli apartheid, The Helix Queer Performance Network presents three artists whose work directly opposes this injustice in the queerest of ways. Palestinian-American performer Mette LouLou von Kohl mines her family's history of exile to make sense of her place in the diaspora, NYC-born Jewish theater artist Una Aya Osato uses burlesque and comedy to resist Zionism, and Egyptian writer/performer m.b. dissects her surreal childhood experiences in Jewish-led Arab/Jewish summer camp. Their performances will be followed by a moderated discussion with the audience.

Mette Loulou von Kohl was born from the orange at the center before the new world came. Currently based in New York City, Mette Loulou is a mixed, queer femme, born to a Lebanese/Palestinian mother and Danish father. She is fascinated by the intersection between her personal identities as a jumping off point to reveal, dismantle and rebuild realities and dreams. Mette Loulou weaves movement, words, and her love for the unexpected into the exploration of her embodied histories. She is a graduate of EMERGENYC- the Hemispheric New York Emerging Performers Program and participant of EmergeLAB and Needing IT ALL at BAX/Brooklyn Arts Exchange, and current Fellow at University Settlement. She is the co-founder of the performance collective A Beautiful Desperation and has performed both nationally and internationally in Canada and across Europe.

m. b. is an egyptian writer of fiction, memoir, and poetry, and has been published in various print and online journals. a resident of crown heights, brooklyn, m. b. worked in a multinational office before abandoning the corporate american dream for the deprivation of the freelance life, and is now an editor, literary and commercial translator, events curator, singer, performance artist, cook, and emerging insomniac. m. b. runs a monthly world-music and other performance series, out of households in brooklyn near you, and has been the recipient of the hedgebrook women's writing retreat, the marble house writing retreat, as well as the needing-it performance fellowship from the helix queer network via brooklyn arts exchange. m. b. has been a featured poet at the bowery poetry club for their weekly the-poet-in-new-york series.

Una Aya Osato aka exHOTic other is queer femme Japanese Jewish self-loving anti-zionist. She is a co-founding member of brASS: Brown RadicalAss Burlesque. A performer, writer and educator from the far far east... of NYC. Her work explores the intersection of where the personal meets political meets funny, and her love for fully embodying her politics led her to burlesque. exHOTic other has performed in dozens of venues, including NYC’s iconic Slipper Room and under the bright lights of Vegas for the Miss Exotic World/Burlesque Hall of Fame competition. Una is also an award-winning actor and playwright of decades who tours her work nationally and internationally, while, duh, eating orientalism for brunch. Since graduating Wesleyan University, she has created six award-winning shows that she performs in theaters, festivals, clubs, universities, community organizations, classrooms, and prisons.

"In a society that prioritizes, privileges, and promotes masculinity and it's highly coercive counterpart, what does it mean to be unappoligetically, agressively, confidently femme? What does it mean to live into something that is simultaneously an aesthetic, a politics, a way of being and thriving in the world, a refuge? Why is there power when femmes come together?

As a way of beginning to unravel the complex ways that we define our femme identities and relations to each other, Femme Skill Share provides a space where femme is centralized and prioritized. Femme Skill Share is a space for femme individuals to share their skills with each other--skills used for survival and skills used for our personal aesthetics and redefinition of selves and those skills in between. 

As a space for rejecting the normative scripts of an assumed masculine agency, we define ""skill"" as any activity or thought or way of doing/being that has been useful to us in some capacity. We invite femmes to share not only tangible skills (e.g. nail painting, hair wrapping, makeup tips, accessorizing, etc), but poems, manifestos, short stories, anecdotes, guides to success, ways to navigate spaces, affirmations, thought endeavors--anything tied to our existences as femme folx. 

There will be snacks (including gluten-free, vegan, and veggie options) and makeup and other products to take home at the end of the night. 


NOTES: 

- Femme Skill Share is a FEMME ONLY SPACE. All who identify as femmes are welcome to come and participate in whatever capacity they choose, and only femmes should be in the space.

- The first hour and a half is explicitly reserved for FEMMES OF COLOR ONLY to share their skills, knowledges, voices, and presences with other femmes of color. This time/space is not for white femmes. Femmes of color should feel safe(r) and free(r) to present any skills, poems, manifestos, et cetera that relates specifically to their cultural and racial identities in a space that acknowledges the ways in which the term ""femme"" has often been used to prioritize more hegemonic acceptible notions of 'femme'.

The last two hours will be an open space for all participants meet and learn from each other. 

- Accessibility: The Steven Donaldson Lounge is physically accessible, with elevator access to physically accessible bathrooms. The SDL is in the basement of Furnald Hall. Those who don't have swipe access to Columbia dorms will receive stickers from CQA board members that will give them access to Furnald and the SDL.",2016-10-27T18:00:00-0400,Steven Donaldson Lounge,https://www.facebook.com/columbiaquam/events,451348925003173,353824108287404

"This is the closing night of Filming at the Borders series, curated by Nora Philippe and presented by the Columbia Maison Française.  Film screening followed by discussion with director Fernand Melgar, Professor Bernard Harcourt, and Nicolas Fischer, moderated by Nora Philippe.

Each year, thousands of men and women in Switzerland are imprisoned without trial or sentence. Simply because they stay in the country illegally, they may be deprived of liberty for up to 18 months before being deported – some of them after having spent up to ten years in Switzerland, worked, paid taxes, and started a family. Those who refuse to leave are handcuffed, tied up, dressed in diapers and helmets, and forcibly put on a plane.

"On October 26th, in the East Gallery of Buell Hall in Maison Francaise,  there will be a film screening of School of Babel, followed by discussion with the director, Julie Bertuccelli, and Associate Professor of French and History at Columbia University, Emmanuelle Saada.

They are Irish, Senegalese, Brazilian, Moroccan, Chinese… They are between 11 and 15 years old and have just arrived in France. For a year they will be all together in the same adaptation class in a Parisian secondary school.  In this multicultural arena, we see the enthusiasm and inner turmoil of these teenagers who, caught in the midst of starting out on a new life, question our preconceived ideas and give us hope for a better future. School of Babe lexplores questions of identity, culture, the relationship to our native language and to the language of exile, through a character-driven script – Bertuccelli chose to make this film because she sees these teenagers as “real heroes.” 

Nominated at the French Césars Awards for Documentary, the film met with great critical and popular success in France, so much so that the school where the film was shot, until then considered an institution with “difficult students” to avoid, became an educational model. 

Special support for this screening is provided by the European Institute at Columbia and the European Union’s Getting to Know Europe Program.

"Troubling Freedom: Antigua and the Aftermath of British Emancipation with  Natasha Lightfoot, Associate Professor of History Columbia University; IRAAS Faculty Fellow

Free & Open to the Public

**Book Description*
In 1834 Antigua became the only British colony in the Caribbean to move directly from slavery to full emancipation. Immediate freedom, however, did not live up to its promise, as it did not guarantee any level of stability or autonomy, and the implementation of new forms of coercion and control made it, in many ways, indistinguishable from slavery. In Troubling Freedom Natasha Lightfoot tells the story of how Antigua's newly freed black working people struggled to realize freedom in their everyday lives, prior to and in the decades following emancipation. She presents freedpeople's efforts to form an efficient workforce, acquire property, secure housing, worship, and build independent communities in response to elite prescriptions for acceptable behavior and oppression. Despite its continued efforts, Antigua's black population failed to convince whites that its members were worthy of full economic and political inclusion. By highlighting the diverse ways freedpeople defined and created freedom through quotidian acts of survival and occasional uprisings, Lightfoot complicates conceptions of freedom and the general narrative that landlessness was the primary constraint for newly emancipated slaves in the Caribbean

*********************
(*Event Discussion Content Warning*: Islamophobia and related hate speech/violence) 

This panel discussion aims to address how Islamophobic political discourse maintains its social block of influence, and how as Americans, the Muslim, Arab, Sikh, and South Asian communities are able to act as agents of change in the upcoming 2016 election. 

The term ‘Islamophobia’ is directly defined as “the fear of Islam”, but is a broad phrase that includes the “prejudices, stereotypes, and discriminating actions resulting from unjustified perceptions” of Muslims and people mistaken for Muslims such as Sikhs, Arabs, and South Asians. 

Islamophobia has since heightened and spread intensely since the September 11, 2001 attacks and since the first hate crime murder post­-9/11 of Balbir Singh Sodi in Mesa, Arizona. Even so, such communities continue to be subjected to islamophobic microaggressions and violence in not only the United States, but also all over the world. In today’s political rhetoric, islamophobia has been exacerbated in attempts to combat international terrorism. 

We would like to thank the Office of the University Chaplain and the Kraft Fund for helping make this event possible! 

Hope to see you there!

"Le voile n’est pas spécifiquement musulman : il l’est devenu. Absente du Coran, c’est une prescription construite progressivement, au terme d’une histoire dont l’épisode colonial est un chapitre majeur. Si le port du voile nous choque, c’est moins en raison de l’outrage fait aux femmes ou de l’entorse à la laïcité que parce qu’il oppose à un ordre visuel fondé sur la transparence, les vestiges d’un régime de visibilité qui privilégiait l’opaque, le caché, le secret et l’obscur. Cela se fait au prix d’un paradoxe que les musulmanes voilées assument plus ou moins volontairement : en montrant qu’elles se cachent, elles cachent en réalité qu’elles se montrent.
