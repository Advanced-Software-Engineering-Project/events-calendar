Really hard. The Moon is so much smaller and lighter than Earth that the laws of physics manifest themselves completely differently. You've got low gravity, no atmosphere, one side is boiling hot whilst the other is freezing cold and in the background Earth is rising over the horizon. In short, if you want to stage it you've got a pretty huge to-do list. I'm going to take you through my turbulent journey of trying to fake the moon landing, and we'll see how the physics of the moon make it an almost impossible task\n\nRemember all of our events are free and open to all ages.
