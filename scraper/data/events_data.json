This seminar will also cover other early career admissions options at top schools like Stanford Graduate School of Business and Yale School of Management.\n\n***PLEASE RSVP by clicking \"Going\" on this event, and use the following link to secure a spot at the event: \nhttp://www.expartus.com/seminar\n\nThe event is FREE to students and will teach applicants how to apply with confidence and when to apply to elite MBA programs to get an edge in the application process. A 1-hour seminar is typically priced at $350.\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn at this seminar: \n\u2022 How to assess whether you should apply to the 2+2 program or postpone your application\n\u2022 Mistakes 2+2 applicants make and how to avoid them\n\u2022 Who to use for recommenders\n\u2022 Other early career application programs (Stanford and Yale)\n\u2022 And much more\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there!\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nA note from Chioma Isiadinso: \n\nI am the CEO of EXPARTUS (www.expartus.com), an admissions consulting and personal branding company that has helped thousands of clients from over 200 countries to gain admission at the world\u2019s best business schools. \n\nWe help our clients discover their personal brand and communicate it effectively through their application, and this unique branding method sets EXPARTUS apart. \n\nAs a former Harvard Business School admissions board member and former director of admissions at Carnegie Mellon University, I have seen firsthand the power of personal branding in helping applicants get admitted to top schools without necessarily being the obvious choice based on their academic and professional credentials. \n\nTop schools want diversity. They want individuals who are passionate and who will change the world. Applicants who are able to make a strong case that they will impact their world and that they are authentic and engaged individuals will always stand out from their competition. This is what we teach our clients at EXPARTUS. \n\nAfter 20 years in the admissions industry I know that personal branding works. I know that authenticity wins. Helping thousands of clients over the nearly 15 years of leading EXPARTUS, with my incredible team of consultants, has proven to me that it\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s not about just having the highest test scores. It\u2019s about self-awareness; helping applicants discover who they are and the impact they want to have in the world. \n\nIn addition to my leadership responsibilities at EXPARTUS, I am an international speaker on the subject of education and admissions and have presented to organizations like the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), JP Morgan, and Bank of America.
