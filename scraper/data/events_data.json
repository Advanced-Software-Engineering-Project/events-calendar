These examples are inspired by the \"Stata tests\" that are often used during interview processes for RA jobs. The tasks cover topics such as merging data sets and using macros, loops, string functions, and datetime functions.

They want individuals who are passionate and who will change the world. Applicants who are able to make a strong case that they will impact their world and that they are authentic and engaged individuals will always stand out from their competition. This is what we teach our clients at EXPARTUS. \n\nAfter 20 years in the admissions industry I know that personal branding works. I know that authenticity wins. Helping thousands of clients over the nearly 15 years of leading EXPARTUS, with my incredible team of consultants, has proven to me that it\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s not about just having the highest test scores. It\u2019s about self-awareness; helping applicants discover who they are and the impact they want to have in the world. \n\nIn addition to my leadership responsibilities at EXPARTUS, I am an international speaker on the subject of education and admissions and have presented to organizations like the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), JP Morgan, and Bank of America.
