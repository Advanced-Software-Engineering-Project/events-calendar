Panelists include:\n\n1. Conor Russomanno, MFA, SEAS '11 \nCo-Founder & CEO | OpenBCI\nPart-Time Faculty | NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program\nPart-Time Faculty | Parsons MFA Design & Technology\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe_cWeiY5G8\nOpenBCI Mission: \"OpenBCI stands for open-source brain-computer interface (BCI). We provide anyone with a computer, the tools necessary to sample the electrical activity of their body. Our versatile and affordable bio-sensing systems can be used to sample electrical brain activity (EEG), muscle activity (EMG), heart rate (EKG), and much more. Our 3D-printable EEG headsets can be used to get research-grade EEG recordings.\" http://openbci.com/\n\n2. Dmitri Chklovskii, PhD, Research Associate Professor at the NYU Neuroscience Institute and the Simons Foundation\nResearch Summary: \"The human brain makes sense of the world and comes up with new ideas with an efficiency, speed and accuracy unattainable by modern computers. Our goal is to understand how the brain analyzes large and complex datasets streamed by sensory organs in order to aid efforts at treating mental illness and building artificial neural systems. We analyze experimental data, assembling connectomes from high-throughput electron microscopy and determining neuronal dynamics from calcium imaging and multi-electrode recordings. Empowered by experimental observations, we are developing a novel algorithmic theory of neural computation.\"\n\n3. Daniel Gardner, PhD, Professor of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College\nResearch Summary: \"The Lab's very newest project addresses a major barrier to progress in neuroscience. Contemporary neuroscientists record increasingly larger numbers of signals from nervous systems and correlate them with many behaviors and with disease states. However, this new capacity to acquire signals simultaneously from a hundred or more neurons or networks far outstrips our ability to analyze and to ask questions about these data, severely limiting progress. To address this imbalance, we have just begun to apply new massively-parallel computer technology to proven analytic methods. Such innovative enhanced analyses will enable neuroscience laboratories to derive greater insight from their data, and so advance our understanding of the relation of neural signals and brain function to sensation, perception, decision, and action. Our major impact, aim, and significance are encapsulated in the acronym NEAT: the Neurophysiology Extended Analysis Tool.\"\n\nRefreshments will be provided!", "start_time": "2016-10-24T20:00:00-0400", "location": "703 Hamilton", "group_url": "https://www.facebook.com/ColumbiaMIS/events", "page_id": "655078074554911", "id": "1785766911680568"}, {"description": "Join us in the GS Lounge for food, prizes, and hourly competitions!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to sign up for the GS Giving Day Thunderclap campaign for a chance to win a free ticket to the GS Gala in the spring and to spread the word about Giving Day: http://bit.ly/cgd16clp", "start_time": "2016-10-26T15:00:00-0400", "location": "Columbia University School of General Studies", "group_url": "https://www.facebook.com/ColumbiaGS/events", "page_id": "29438666163", "id": "1164125783624470"}, {"start_time": "2016-10-27T15:00:00-0400", "page_id": "458637640940036", "id": "212340105853627", "group_url": "https://www.facebook.com/ColumbiaOGP/events", "description": "Learn about the semester, academic year and summer program options at KCJS.

Gather with colleagues from the world over to learn the narrative skills of close reading, attentive listening, and creative writing. Find out how your own imagination can reveal things you know unawares. Experience the deep bonds that can form among clinicians and those who care about health care in short periods of small group intensive narrative work. Recognize and be recognized as ones who have care within them. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany persons engaged in health care, either as patients or providers, are hungry to give and receive care. Attentive listening, creative contact, singular accuracy, and personal fidelity have gone missing from the routines of our practices. Among the many responses to the failures of our current health care system is Narrative Medicine. Developed at Columbia University in 2000, Narrative Medicine fortifies clinical practice with the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by stories of illness. We realize that the care of the sick unfolds in stories, and we recognize that the central event of health care is for a patient to give an account of self and a clinician to skillfully receive it. \n\nThe clinical routines and the teaching methods of Narrative Medicine, our experience and research show, can transform practice and training. Time-tested teaching approaches can help participants who seek to convey to their learners the skills of empathic interviewing, reflective practice, narrative ethics, self-awareness, and creating and sustaining healing intersubjective contact with patients and colleagues.\n\nWORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:\nFrom Friday at 2 pm to Sunday at 5 pm, participants gather for plenary presentations by the founders of the Program in Narrative Medicine alternating with small-group seminars. You and seven other participants will form a small group that stays together for the entire weekend, while faculty facilitators rotate through the groups. The large presentations by faculty open up themes of how stories work, creativity, ethics, bearing witness, and empathy, while the small groups practice rigorous skills in close reading, creative writing, and responding to the writings of others. Participants will receive a packet of readings prior to the conference that will include seminar articles in the field of narrative medicine by leading educators.\n\nPARTICIPANTS WILL:\n* Develop the narrative competence to nourish empathic doctor-patient relationships\n* Learn narrative communication strategies for patient-centered and life-framed practice\n* Build habits of reflective practice that enhance professionalism and nurture clinical communities\n* Acquire pedagogic skills to teach methods of narrative medicine\n* Replace isolation with affiliation, cultivate enduring collegial alliances, and reveal meaning in clinical practice\n* Held at the Columbia University Medical Center campus, these weekends will provide opportunities for individual consultations with faculty, shared meals, informal social gatherings, and access to the cultural offerings of New York City.\n\nDISCOUNT FOR COHORTS:\nBased on our experience that cohorts of participants from an institution are better able to continue their narrative learning and to ignite narrative projects at their home institution, we now offer a discount of $100 on the tuition of each individual who attends within a cohort of two or more.\n\nContinuing Education credits are offered for physicians, dentists, and social workers.

Raised by former hippies, Moully was exposed to far more color than one would expect in the rigorously orthodox Chassidic community. Moully\u2019s formal education in day schools in Australia and later at the Rabbinical College of America did not include formal art classes but his inner passion yearned for expression. After dabbling in various forms of art Moully found an expression for his creativity in the silkscreen process.\nMoully\u2019s art contrasts strong Judaic and Chassidic images with vibrant bold colors to create a startling combination which he describes as \u201cChassidic Pop Art\u201d.\nMoully\u2019s art reveals that the essence of Chassidic thought is far from black and white.\nUnder the black hat there is a wealth of vibrant colorful energy waiting to be released.\nYitzchok Moully is the founder of The Creative Soul and lives in Hillside NJ, together with his wife Batsheva and six children.\n\nOpen to all Alumni, faculty and grad students.

What does it mean to live into something that is simultaneously an aesthetic, a politics, a way of being and thriving in the world, a refuge? Why is there power when femmes come together?\n\nAs a way of beginning to unravel the complex ways that we define our femme identities and relations to each other, Femme Skill Share provides a space where femme is centralized and prioritized. Femme Skill Share is a space for femme individuals to share their skills with each other--skills used for survival and skills used for our personal aesthetics and redefinition of selves and those skills in between. \n\nAs a space for rejecting the normative scripts of an assumed masculine agency, we define \"skill\" as any activity or thought or way of doing/being that has been useful to us in some capacity. We invite femmes to share not only tangible skills (e.g. nail painting, hair wrapping, makeup tips, accessorizing, etc), but poems, manifestos, short stories, anecdotes, guides to success, ways to navigate spaces, affirmations, thought endeavors--anything tied to our existences as femme folx. \n\nThere will be snacks (including gluten-free, vegan, and veggie options) and makeup and other products to take home at the end of the night. \n\n\nNOTES: \n\n- Femme Skill Share is a FEMME ONLY SPACE. All who identify as femmes are welcome to come and participate in whatever capacity they choose, and only femmes should be in the space.\n\n- The first hour and a half is explicitly reserved for FEMMES OF COLOR ONLY to share their skills, knowledges, voices, and presences with other femmes of color. This time/space is not for white femmes. Femmes of color should feel safe(r) and free(r) to present any skills, poems, manifestos, et cetera that relates specifically to their cultural and racial identities in a space that acknowledges the ways in which the term \"femme\" has often been used to prioritize more hegemonic acceptible notions of 'femme'.\n\nThe last two hours will be an open space for all participants meet and learn from each other. \n\n- Accessibility: The Steven Donaldson Lounge is physically accessible, with elevator access to physically accessible bathrooms. The SDL is in the basement of Furnald Hall.

Immediate freedom, however, did not live up to its promise, as it did not guarantee any level of stability or autonomy, and the implementation of new forms of coercion and control made it, in many ways, indistinguishable from slavery. In Troubling Freedom Natasha Lightfoot tells the story of how Antigua's newly freed black working people struggled to realize freedom in their everyday lives, prior to and in the decades following emancipation. She presents freedpeople's efforts to form an efficient workforce, acquire property, secure housing, worship, and build independent communities in response to elite prescriptions for acceptable behavior and oppression. Despite its continued efforts, Antigua's black population failed to convince whites that its members were worthy of full economic and political inclusion. By highlighting the diverse ways freedpeople defined and created freedom through quotidian acts of survival and occasional uprisings, Lightfoot complicates conceptions of freedom and the general narrative that landlessness was the primary constraint for newly emancipated slaves in the Caribbean\nCo-sponsored by History Department at Columbia University \n**Books will be available for purchase with Book Culture Bookstore onsite**", "start_time": "2016-10-26T18:00:00-0400", "location": "Faculty House | Columbia University", "group_url": "https://www.facebook.com/ColumbiaAFAM/events", "page_id": "197174936966015", "id": "1606200993009544"}, {"description": "Come join the Philolexian Society for Geezer night, where Philos young and old come together for a night of fun and debate!
