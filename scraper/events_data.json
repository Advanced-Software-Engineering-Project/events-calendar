Refreshments will be served.\n\nOHMA OPEN HOUSE\n- Information session\n- Learn about our new Future Voices Fellowship \n- Meet OHMA students and alums\n- Mini-interviewing workshop, taught by OHMA Co-Directors Mary Marshall Clark & Amy Starecheski \n\nIn this open house, Nyssa Chow (OHMA 2015) will be presenting a portion of her thesis, which focuses on the lived experience of history as told by three women born in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1920s. What was life in the British colony like for these women? In \"Still.Life.,\" you will see and hear accounts that are grounded in that time and place, but also stories that are timeless, deeply personal and universally human.\n\nNyssa is an OHMA student and Teaching Fellow in our Method, Theory, and Interpretation course this fall through Columbia\u2019s Center for Teaching and Learning. Her work with OHMA Co-Director Mary Marshall Clark to transform oral history by teaching visual literacy recently received Columbia\u2019s Faculty Provost Award.\n\n***\n\nOHMA is the first program of its kind: a one-year interdisciplinary Master of Arts degree training students in oral history method and theory. Our graduates work in museums, historical societies, advocacy organizations, media, the arts, education, human rights, and development. OHMA is also excellent preparation for doctoral work in fields like anthropology, history, journalism, and American studies or professional degrees in law, education, or social work. \n\nJointly run by the Columbia Center for Oral History Research, one of the preeminent oral history centers in the world, and INCITE, a lively hub for interdisciplinary research in the humanities and social sciences, OHMA connects students with the intellectual resources of a major research university, and with the intimate society of a small cohort of talented students.\n\nDuring a year at OHMA, students learn the skills of digital audio and video production and editing, digital archiving, oral history project design and interviewing, and both historical and social science analysis. Working with an OHMA faculty member, each student is guided through the process of creating a thesis or capstone project. Past projects have taken the form of academic and creative essays, film and audio documentaries, performances, exhibits, and multimedia websites. OHMA students also have access to elective courses taught anywhere within the University and exclusive oral history internship opportunities.\n\nPlease review our admissions page for further information and RSVP to our Eventbrite page in the ticket section above. We looking forward to meeting you in person on November 3!\n\nhttp://oralhistory.columbia.edu/tuition-and-aid", "title": "Nov. 3: OHMA Fall Open House", "start_time": "2016-11-03T18:30:00-0400", "location": "Columbia University Oral History Masters Program", "group_url": "https://www.facebook.com/Columbia.OHMA/events", "page_id": "264168007770", "id": "170315343413888", "photo_url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/s720x720/14468337_10154241417382771_2023750575001122362_o.jpg"}, {"description": "Helllo HRSMA Students!

In the US, in Israel, and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, mass incarceration and policing have emerged as ubiquitous tools of social control. The combination of structural conditions, apartheid laws, and regular acts of calculated violence work to secure and reproduce white supremacy in the US and Zionist supremacy in Palestine. We see this work being done every single day, from the regular police executions of black bodies in the streets of major US cities, to the regular campaigns of executions, bombing, and gassing of Palestinian civilians conducted by the Israeli occupation forces.\n\n\nOn Thursday, November 3rd, join MAD (Mobilized African Diaspora) and Columbia University Apartheid Divest in dissecting the US and Israeli carceral states and discussing the history of resistance to these structures, from the First Palestinian Intifada to the ongoing US prison strike. How are these repressive apparatuses set up in the first place? What drives those subordinated under them to finally rebel? How are conditions within prisons set up so as to destroy this spirit of rebellion?

After his successes with Cape No. 7  (Taiwan\u2019s highest-grossing film of all time), Seediq Bale, and Kano, Wei has taken this unusual move of launching 52Hz, I love you abroad before its January 26, 2017 Taiwan release.\n\nThis movie will present a series of romantic comedy stories with beautiful original songs that take place in modern Taipei City, Taiwan, on Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d. The film\u2019s title is inspired by the 52Hz whale, a creature dubbed the \u201cworld\u2019s loneliest whale\u201d because no other whales can hear its 52Hz frequency calls.\n\n\u201cI found this whale very fascinating; it echoes the movie\u2019s theme, which is loneliness,\u201d says Wei. \u201cJust like how no one hears this lonely whale, how many people in Taipei have love inside of them but nobody knows? Or simply need a chance to say \u2018I love you\u2019 and be heard?\u201d\n\nIt appears that 52Hz, I love you represents a shift from Wei\u2019s past work, which tended to incorporate narratives from Taiwan\u2019s history and shift the limelight away from Taipei. Regardless, Wei hopes that this new approach will be even more effective at capturing audiences\u2019 attention.\n\u201cThe movie we\u2019re making this time is going to be different from before,\u201d says Wei. \u201cThis time, we are bringing everyone happiness and satisfaction. I hope we can really accomplish this.\u201d\n\nEnglish introduction was adopted from the article be Anthony Kao\nhttp://www.cinemaescapist.com/2016/10/52hz-i-love-you-north-america-premiere/\n\nVisit the Facebook page and youtube for more details.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/52hziloveyounyc/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhUXXi-EfRs", "title": "\u300a52 Hz, I Love You\u300b@ Columbia University", "start_time": "2016-11-22T15:00:00-0500", "location": "Cowin Center Teachers College, Columbia University", "group_url": "https://www.facebook.com/columbiatgsa/events", "page_id": "864052077004433", "id": "359845134352439", "photo_url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/s720x720/14856016_1152554811487490_1957171280876713497_o.jpg"}, {"description": "Don't have any Halloween plans?
